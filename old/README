All data (from .root files) must be preprocessed in preprocess.py 
    (data analysis figures are in data_analysis.py, which let us explore variable distributions and data structures)

That data then must then be reformatted and run through a model in main.py 
    (reformatting code is in format_data.py, model analysis figures can be modified in model_analysis.py, 
    model is kept in models.py)

Constants are kept in constants.py
