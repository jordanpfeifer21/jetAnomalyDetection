Jet Anomaly Detection is a PyTorch Geometric-based framework for detecting anomalous high-energy jets using graph neural networks. The system supports both unsupervised (autoencoder-based) and supervised (classifier-based) learning, utilizing particle-level features and k-nearest-neighbor graph constructions.

# Features

- Graph-based autoencoder for unsupervised anomaly detection
- Binary classifier for supervised learning tasks
- Hyperparameter sweep module for model tuning
- Visualization tools for loss curves, ROC curves, anomaly scores
- Modular preprocessing pipeline with feature engineering and normalization

# Usage

## TL;DR:

```bash
cd jetAnomalyDetection
source setup_venv.sh

# modify `setup_data_symlinks.sh` to add qcd and wjet remote data directories
source setup_data_symlinks.sh

# modify `configs/config.yaml` if needed
py scripts/preprocessing.py -t background
py scripts/preprocessing.py -t signal
# can use paths to singular files instead

# optional
py helpers/print_df_info.py --path data/preprocessed/qcd/              # or `wjet/`
py helpers/join_dfs.py --filter 170to300 --path data/preprocessed/qcd/ # or `wjet/`

# modify `configs/config.yaml to point to the preprocessed data folders
py scripts/processing.py -b path/to/processed/qcd.pkl -s path/to/processed/wjet.pkl -B "qcd file label" -S "wjet file label"

# visualisation e.g.
py visualize/plot_distributions.py -q path/to/pre-or-processed.pkl -t preproc -p rawfj_pt

...
py scripts/run_train_autoencoder.py -...
```

## Overview

- We preprocess `.root` jet data files into intermediate pickled DataFrames (`.pkl`),

- process these intermediate files (scale using background data, feature engineer, etc.),

- and, once we have the proper distributions, train the classifier (old) or autoencoder (currently developing).

- Parameter sweeps are performed via: `scripts/*_sweep.py`

- (NOTE: everything runs on Linux; use WSL if locally on Windows)

### NOTE: Training on Brown resources
You'll likely have the data downloaded onto Brux/Oscar, so run from those.\
You *could* run from Brux directly on the login node, but everything's way faster on Oscar with the right resource settings.\
(e.g. the training scripts are configured to use CUDA whenever possible)\
\
To setup an Oscar account, follow the steps here: https://docs.ccv.brown.edu/oscar/\
The steps to submit GPU jobs are listed here: https://docs.ccv.brown.edu/oscar/gpu-computing/submit-gpu\
\
**TL;DR:** once you setup your Oscar account, use sth like PuTTY/your native terminal to SSH into Oscar.\
If your files are stored on Brux/HEP, run `cd /HEP/export/home/<account_name>/<path/to/jetAnomalyDetection>/` to locate your Brux files.\
(You could copy these over to your Oscar directory, if you get permission/SSH key issues with Git.)\
To run your training scripts directly from the terminal and see their output, run `interact -q gpu -g 1` to start an interactive session w/ 1 GPU.\
Don't forget to change `device` to `"cuda"` in `config.yaml`, and run the training script.\
To submit a batch job... just check the link above, pls.\
\
If running on Brux/some other cluster w/o a way to submit jobs like on Oscar, prepend your command with `nohup`.\
This starts the script in the background and writes terminal output to `nohup.out` in the current directory.\
This means you can close the SSH connection and it'll still keep running.\
Just make sure to check the output every now and then with `cat nohup.out`, to see if there's been any errors.\
e.g. `nohup py scripts/preprocessing.py -t background`\
Lastly, do `source shownohup.sh` to print the output of `nohup` automatically, including `tqdm`'s visuals!

### First time

- Run `source setup_venv.sh` to setup the venv and download all requirements.
    - if anything goes wrong, `deactivate` and try adding or removing requirements from `reqs-short.txt`

- Run `source start_venv.sh` anytime to start the venv, and `deactivate` to terminate it

- Modify `configs/config.yaml` to customise data locations, hyperparameters, etc.

- `py` symlinks to `.venv/bin/python3.9`, so you can just use that in the terminal

- For any script, run `py <path/to/script.py> -h` to check what command-line parameters are used

### Preprocessing

- If you only have a single file to preprocess, run `py scripts/preprocessing.py -p <filepath> -t [background/signal]`
    - You should also set `move_to_used` to `false` if this is in a directory you can't write to
    - Remember to add `nohup` if you want to leave it running over SSH!

- Otherwise, collect your background (QCD) and/or signal (WJet) `.root` data files into two folders

- Assuming your raw `.root` data is within some remote or local directory:
    - Add those directories as `qcd_dir` and `wjet_dir` into `setup_data_symlinks.sh` (or comment one out)
    - Run `source setup_data_symlinks.sh` to create data symlinks/shortcuts into `./data/raw/`, to access the data easier
    - Now `move_to_used: true` in the config will work, moving `.root` files into a `./used/` subdirectory to keep track of which files have been preprocessed

- Run `py scripts/preprocessing.py -t [background/signal]` to preprocess using the default raw data directory
    - The default directory defined in `config.yaml` is where `setup_data_symlinks.sh` saves the shortcuts to 
    - If you have multiple `.root` files with the same label, e.g. "170to300_1", "..._2", "..._3",
        - this will save everything into the same folder, assuming your data paths are set up correctly
    - ^ with different labels, e.g. "QCD170to300", "QCD1400to1800",
        - then add `-s` to save each file's outputs to a subfolder
        - NOTE: this will also automatically concatenate all the files in the subfolder into `concat_....pkl`, so you should delete the files in subfolders other than the `concat_....pkl` one

- You can use `--upperpt` and `--lowerpt` to set fatjet pt bounds for the data
    - e.g. if you want to train the model on the same pt ranges, so the model can't just learn the pt

### Processing

- NOTE: This processes a pair of QCD and WJet jets together, scaling using the QCD data
    - The WJet's HT range should be around double the QCD Pt range!
    - You'll likely have a folder of multiple `.pkl` files for each jet; these files will be joined during processing

- Run `py scripts/processing.py -b <path/to/preprocessed/qcd.pkl> -s <path/to/wjet/preprocessed>`
    - This will process the preprocessed `.pkl` files in the specified paths (defaults are set in `config.yaml`)
    - You can also add labels for each jet using `--label_bg` and `--label_sg`
    - and upper/lower pt bounds using `--upperpt` and `--lowerpt`, if you preprocessed the data with the new script
    - NOTE: if you add `--filter`, then the program will use those labels to filter out preprocessed files


### Training

- Run `py scripts/run_train_autoencoder.py -b <path/to/processed/qcd.pkl> -s <path/to/processed/wjet.pkl>`
    - or set the defaults in `config.yaml`
    - Can configure the KNN neighbours, graph construction method, etc.

### Visualisation

- `processing.py` saves plots of the processed data distributions (mainly their `log_pt`) into `plots/proc_distr_....png`
    - If you enable `show_plot` in `config.yaml`, then it'll try `plt.show`-ing these plots

- `visualize/plot_distributions.py` has a buncha options for plotting distributions, use `--help`

### Helpers

- `py helpers/print_df_info.py --path <file_or_folder>` to inspect the size `(rows * columns)` of a `.pkl` DataFrame (or a folder of `.pkl` files)
    - Use as a sanity check to make sure a data file contains actual data
    - Add `-c` to print the columns, and `-r` to try printing the entire DataFrame

- `py helpers/join_dfs.py --path <folder> --filter <jet_label>` to join all the `.pkl` files in the folder containing the specified label
    - e.g. to join all `QCD_Pt1800to2400_*.pkl` files

- `raw_data_info` contains the treenames and branch names for the TTrees in the raw `.root` files, e.g. "Events" or "FatJet"

- and more!

### Development instructions

- Check out the funcs in `helpers/helpers_main.py` to avoid rewriting common stuff

- `logging.info` should print to terminal AND save to a logfile in `logs`; set it up with `helpers_main.log_config(filename)`!

- graphing data distributions is very easy with `visualize/visualise_all_props.sh` or directly with `plot_distributions.py`
