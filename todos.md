# To-dos

## Fri - 11.07.25

**NOW:**
- Analysing Pt distributions of the new btv-nano data between a matching QCD and WJet pair:
    - from the raw ROOT files (Arjun already did this, showed pretty big separation)
    - after preprocessing and combining into one file each (does my preprocessing squish the separation, somehow?)
    - after processing
    - all of the above, but with log Pt instead; this is what `processing.py` currently does, but it shows very little separation compared to Arjun's plots
- Could plot pt/eta/phi of fatjets!


- Parameter sweeps take a LOOONG while (hours), so we should try to use the GPU on Brux or LXPlus, or speed it up anyhow
    - GPU computation
    - using JAX or other JIT options
    - playing around w/ the number of workers etc.
- Counterpoint: not



## Tue - 15.07.25

**DONE:**
- Concatenated, organised, and sent all preprocessed data files to Arjun
    - Processed `QCD_PT-170to300_13p6TeV + WJetsToQQ_HT-400to600`

- Slight fixes here n there, adding more fields to processed data visualisation (like Arjun's done)

- Joined and organised preproc'd files, sent the link to Arjun so he can use them for processing (takes 5-20 mins) and training
    - processing now just takes `python3.9 scripts/processing.py -b <qcdpath.pkl> -s <wjetpath.pkl>`

- Have been trying to transition more into the technical/model side of things, but a bunch of technical issues still pop up
    - Virtual environment was still incomplete, so I finally diagnosed the issues and found the correct versions to install
    - still may need tweaking if I try to use GPU or CPU drivers; for now, moved everything to CPU

- Starting to train the old autoencoder w/ the new preproc files; shows my preproc + proc pipeline works, loss decreases
    - doesn't have Arjun's modifications yet

- (small fun stuff) Added subfolder/concat support, refactored pre/processing, removed `ak.to_numpy` etc.









## Fri - 18.07.25

**Not imp:**
- Uprooting the `.root` files, plotting distributions of different features flattened out
    - and overlaying similar features to see how similar they are
    - arjun hasn't uprooted the new .root files - do it and save the plots!
    - correlation heatmaps? check out arjun's one     


**DONE:**
- Diagnosing the QCD50to80 issue - why do all events get rejected?
    - uprooting is confusing me a bit; try using arjun's pt_comparison.py to graph the FatJet_pt distributions for all QCDs
        - why are they mostly empty??
    - need to check/graph the data during get_fatjets() in preprocessing.py, too!
        - different fields? is it still pt, or eta, or etc all at the same time?
        - maybe count the number of events that are filtered out by certain filters? `len(fj[!filter])`
    - the main thing to do is cross-check with the other .root files, see what's different\
(answer: PT lower bound)

- Plotting distribution of Pts for events with multiple fatjets instead of flattening them out
    - plotting for all btvnano `.root` data, to check for useful differences
        - saved in a folder for future reference, `
    - points:
        - the 200 GeV cutoff actually nixes a lot of data that involves multiple fatjets in the same event
            - since their Pts sum up to close to the average Pt
            - doesn't this mean we're using less data? or is it not a good idea to sum these tgt during preproc

- Fixed preprocessing bug that was making everything 10x slower; finally preprocessing files within 200-300 range   

- Summing ALL the QCD data files, and THEN taking the 200-300 GeV Pt slice from both QCD and WJet (WWto4Q)
    - point is more data + to see if the autoencoder can learn even when the Pt ranges are so similar
    - tool to do this! lol
        - and save diff ranges to train with?
    - *ISSUES:*
        - doesn't seem to be easily possible to use the preprocessed data directly
            - coz it saves ratio of fj to pfcs! what's that about?
            - preproc needs to be done again for each range; not very helpful
        - preprocessing all the QCD data separately

- figure out how preproc matches fatjets with fatjetpfcands
    - inject some printing into preproceventsslice
        - does it broadcast?
    - with this, we can figure out how to add the metadata
    - each fatjet should have its pt recorded, alongside... pfcands? what other fields?

- Fixed venv. again.
    - again!! at least it works fr now from a fresh install.

- changing all the cpu/cuda prompts to ACTUALLY use config.yaml

- Graphing processed fj_pt ranges to make sure slicing works

- Look into ways to use Brux's GPU!
    - Added documentation to note how to use Oscar

- How to mount brux on Oscar, to use oscar gpu
    - /HEP/export/home/mstamenk/jet-anomaly-summer25/btv-nano
    - /HEP/export/home/<account>

- modify `scaling.py` etc. to automatically add additional metadata columns during processing

- graph the data distributions for msoftdrop etc

- slice the wjet data (saved as concat, ready to use for training)
    - check the pt distribution of the concatenated pt200-300 new datafiles (saved plot)

- check out the model, the kNN distances
    - hybrid metric is a weighted sum of the invariant mass inverse and geometric distance


**NOW:**

- the weighting thing!
    - check out specifically the loss fn
    - figure out where to weight
    - add the column to processing
        - GRAPH THIS! GRAPH THE BINS!!!!!!!!!!!
    - modify the trainer to do this step only if that column exists

- test alphasweep!

- training step: weight the rawfj_pt ranges to flatten pt distribution so that the network doesnt learn the pt
    - may improve performance
    - higher jet pts have more pfcands, but second order
    - variable transformation to flatten distributions

- get the fatjet mass, and normalise with the particle mass to get dimensionless params
    - can look at distribution of the normalised mass
    - reprocess all the data! and take Pt slices again

- particle tagging metadata during preproc (marko)

- performing sweeps and trying different parameters
    - also different parameters for Oscar, to see what leads to the best performance (GPUs, CPUs, memory)

- familiarise w/:
    - the visualisations and other tools, update if needed (e.g. graphing other properties)
    - the model and what's been done; what features have been used to train? what hasn't been tried?
        - other parameters, pfcands
    - if successful, we can train for way more epochs hopefully

    - using PFCands instead of FatJet? can add to 
    - Plot PFCands! since we may be using those for training



**less important:**

- try changing preproc processes to consume sections of events instead of just the indices? to avoid loading multiple times

- Using the visualize() func in processing.py to visualise stuff like the zeroes after processing
    - what gets excluded when `not include_zeros`? how are scaled zeroes distributed?
    - also to visualise processed distributions in general across all fields
        - errors out at mass I think, coz of inf/nan errors! try to filter out and redo
    - save different useful plots permanently (analysing all the raw/processed data)

- Can add more metadata than currently added
    - add to documentation in readme! e.g. how to graph the fatjet pt ranges from preproc data






**next meet:**
- added more metadata columns to the data, and an easy automatic way of adding the data through constants
    - the data added and re-processed: []

- ik i been working moreso on technical stuff, a lot which are under the covers
    - but im getting into the model and tryna improve it; would like to continue this into next sem

- adding the weights to processing as a separate file/step
    - bins graph: ...
    - (can ask about no. of bins to use?)
